The car he was in with his family was hit in Oss by a car that drove through a red light at high speed. \n\n"He was my best friend. I\'ve known him for almost four years, I heard from school and a friend that the boy who died in the accident was Johnathan," says Amir at the improvised memorial site where flowers are laid and candles are lit. "It\'s very intense, I really had a hard time after I heard it. We just laid flowers. He was also commemorated at school." \n\nAmir is happy about that. "It\'s nice that he is being talked about, also on the news. That way he is not forgotten. At school we were able to write letters. The school principal also reflected on what it\'s like when such terrible things happen at such a young age." Johnathan was in the third grade. His brother Jaydon (12) was also in the car and was seriously injured. "We have to wait and see how he and his family are doing. I hope all the passengers make it," said Amir. A third child (8) from the family was also seriously injured in the collision.\n\nRan a red light\nThe accident happened on Christmas Day at the intersection of the Megensebaan and the Singel 1940-1945. CCTV footage of the accident is circulating online. It shows a car with two 18-year-old men in it running a red light at very high speed. They hit the family\'s car.\n\nThe men were arrested. They were slightly injured. Both had too much alcohol, according to a breath test. A blood test was taken, which should show how much alcohol they had. The result is not yet known. The passenger has since been released and is no longer considered a suspect.\n\nOmroep Brabant deliberately chooses not to show the surveillance footage of the accident, because of the impact of the accident. The police also announce that they have the footage in their possession and will include it in the investigation.',
